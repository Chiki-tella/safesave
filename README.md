# 🚀 Safe‑Save
Blockchain‑Powered Ibimina Platform
#📌 Overview
Safe‑Save is a blockchain‑based platform that digitizes Ibimina (community savings groups) using Cardano smart contracts.
It brings transparency, trust, and automation to informal savings by eliminating fraud, disputes, and poor record‑keeping.

In Safe‑Save, the blockchain acts as the treasurer — not a person.

#❗ Problem
Traditional Ibimina groups suffer from:

Lack of transparency

Fund mismanagement and fraud

Manual or unreliable records

Loan conflicts and unfair rules

No visibility into group investments

These issues often break trust and collapse groups.

#💡 Solution
Safe‑Save uses smart contracts to automate and secure all financial activities:

💰 Transparent savings tracking

💸 Automated loans, interest, and penalties

📈 Clear investment and profit visibility

🎁 Rewards for consistent saving

📊 Real‑time dashboards for members

All transactions are immutable, verifiable, and fair.

#✨ Core Features
Savings Module — deposits, streaks, group balance

Loan Module — eligibility rules, repayments, penalties

Investment Module — ROI tracking, profit distribution

Rewards Module — tokens / NFT badges

Transparency Dashboard — full group financial overview
